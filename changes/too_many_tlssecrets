  o Removed features:
    - Relays no longer support the obsolete "RSA-SHA256-TLSSecret"
      authentication method, which used a dangerously short RSA key,
      and which required access TLS session internals. The current method
      ("Ed25519-SHA256-RFC5705") has been supported since 0.3.0.1-alpha.
      Closes ticket 41020.
