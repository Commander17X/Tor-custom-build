  o Major feature (happy families):

    - Clients and relays now support "happy families", a system to
      simplify relay family operation and improve directory performance.
      With "happy families", relays in a family shares a secret "family key",
      which they use to prove their membership in the family.
      Implements proposal 321; closes ticket 41009.

      Note that until enough clients are upgraded,
      relay operators will still need to configure MyFamily lists.
      But once clients no longer depend on those lists,
      we will be able to remove them entirely,
      thereby simplifying family operation,
      and making microdescriptor downloads approximately 80% smaller.
